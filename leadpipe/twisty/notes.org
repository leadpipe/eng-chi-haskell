* To do
** DONE Try out using arrays in Wreath
** DONE Rename everything to Twisty
** DONE Move FaceTwist4 into the Cube module, rename
** DONE Generalize Twisty move types: index + twist
** DONE Come up with Alg transforms for Cube
** Write Tetra3, findTetra3
** Write Dodeca3
** Write Dodeca5
** Write Octa, Octa3, Octa4?
** Write GearedCube?
** Write Cube5?
** REPL for moves? -- need transforms, like mirrors and rotations
** Templatize polyhedron type families (?)
** Write test modules

* Required cabal modules
** data-memocombinators
** test-framework-th
** test-framework-quickcheck2
** parallel (current version)

* Building and running

# building for profiling
ghc -prof -auto-all --make -O2 findCube4

# running with the profiler
./findCube4 +RTS -p

# building optimized
ghc --make -O2 findCube4

# building for threaded execution
ghc --make -threaded -O2 -rtsopts findCube4

# running threaded with 3 processors
./findCube4 +RTS -N3
