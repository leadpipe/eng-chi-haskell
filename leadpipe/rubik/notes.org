* To do
** DONE Recast all polyhedra in terms of type families
** DONE Make Move be a Puzzle associated type
** DONE Simplify Algorithm creation
** Rewrite Algorithm parser; fix cube FaceTwist parser to reject 0 moves
** Templatize polyhedron type families
** Write test modules
** Reorganize algebra code:
*** Separate Group module?
*** A bunch of the stuff in Cycles has nothing to do with cycles
*** Separate Wreath module?
** Resurrect space-searching code

* Required cabal modules
** data-memocombinators
   - This is a simple module that doesn't currently work on 7.0; we'll see if we
     keep it.
